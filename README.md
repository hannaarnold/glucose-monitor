# Glucose Monitor Application

> This application was written in Kotlin and created in Android Studio. It allows a user to select a date and record their glucose levels before breakfast, after breakfast, after lunch, and after dinner. A message is displayed to the user indicating whether their glucose levels are normal, abnormal, or hypoglycemic. The user also has an option to send a report of their glucose levels that day to an outside application (such as messenger or email). 


> The record is saved to a database which the user can access if they click the "History" button. A list of previous dates that the user had created records for are displayed. The user has options to create a new entry for a specified date, or click a date that is listed to view and edit that information.


> In order to use, Android Studio will have to be installed, as well as an emulator. Open the project in Android Studio and click "Build". Once the application has successfully been built, run the app on the emulator.
